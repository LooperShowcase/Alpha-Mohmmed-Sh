        PlayStation (Japanese: プレイステーション, Hepburn: Pureisutēshon,
        officially abbreviated as PS) is a video gaming brand that consists of
        five home video game consoles, two handhelds, a media center, and a
        smartphone, as well as an online service and multiple magazines. The
        brand is produced by Sony Interactive Entertainment, a division of Sony;
        the first PlayStation console was released in Japan in December 1994,
        and worldwide the following year.[1] The original console in the series
        was the first console of any type to ship over 100 million units, doing
        so in under a decade.[2] Its successor, the PlayStation 2, was released
        in 2000; it is the best-selling home console to date, having reached
        over 155 million units sold by the end of 2012.[3] Sony's next console,
        the PlayStation 3, was released in 2006, selling over 87.4 million units
        by March 2017.[4] Sony's next console, the PlayStation 4, was released
        in 2013, selling a million units within a day, becoming the fastest
        selling console in history.[5] The latest console in the series, the
        PlayStation 5, was released in 2020[6] and sold 10 million units in its
        first 249 days, unseating its predecessor as the fastest-selling
        PlayStation console to-date.[7] The first handheld console in the
        series, the PlayStation Portable (PSP), sold a total of 80 million units
        worldwide by November 2013.[8] Its successor, the PlayStation Vita
        (PSVita), which launched in Japan in December 2011 and in most other
        major territories in February 2012, sold over four million units by
        January 2013.[9] PlayStation TV is a microconsole and a non-portable
        variant of the PlayStation Vita handheld game console.[10] Other
        hardware released as part of the PlayStation series includes the PSX, a
        digital video recorder which was integrated with the PlayStation and
        PlayStation 2, though it was short-lived due to its high price and was
        never released outside Japan, as well as a Bravia television set which
        has an integrated PlayStation 2. The main series of controllers utilized
        by the PlayStation series is the DualShock, which is a line of
        vibration-feedback gamepad having sold 28 million controllers by June
        2008.[11] The PlayStation Network is an online service with about 110

        virtual market, the PlayStation Store, which allows the purchase and
        download of games and various forms of multimedia, a subscription-based
        online service known as PlayStation Plus and a social gaming networking
        service called PlayStation Home, which had over 41 million users
        worldwide at the time of its closure in March 2015.[14] PlayStation
        Mobile (formerly PlayStation Suite) is a software framework that
        provides PlayStation content on mobile devices. Version 1.xx supports
        both PlayStation Vita, PlayStation TV and certain devices that run the
        Android operating system, whereas version 2.00 released in 2014 only
        targeted PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV.[15] Content set to be
        released under the framework consist of only original PlayStation games
        currently.[16] Seventh generation PlayStation products also use the
        XrossMediaBar, which is an Technology & Engineering Emmy Award–winning

        LiveArea was launched for the PlayStation Vita, which integrates social
        networking elements into the interface. Additionally, the PlayStation 2
        and PlayStation 3 consoles also featured support for Linux-based
        operating systems; Linux for PlayStation 2 and OtherOS respectively,
        though this has since been discontinued. The series has also been known
        for its numerous marketing campaigns, the latest of which being the
        "Greatness Awaits" and eventually, "Play Has No Limits" commercials in
        the United States. The series also has a strong line-up of first-party
        games due to PlayStation Studios, a group of many studios owned by Sony
        Interactive Entertainment that exclusively developed them for
        PlayStation consoles. In addition, the series features various budget
        re-releases of games by Sony with different names for each region; these
        include the Greatest Hits, Platinum, Essentials, and The Best selection
        of games
