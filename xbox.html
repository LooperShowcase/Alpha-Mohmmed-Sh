      Xbox is a video gaming brand created and owned by Microsoft. The brand
      consists of five video game consoles, as well as applications (games),
      streaming services, an online service by the name of Xbox network, and the
      development arm by the name of Xbox Game Studios. The brand was first
      introduced in the United States in November 2001, with the launch of the
      original Xbox console. The original device was the first video game
      console offered by an American company after the Atari Jaguar stopped
      sales in 1996. It reached over 24 million units sold by May 2006.[1]
      Microsoft's second console, the Xbox 360, was released in 2005 and has
      sold 86 million units as of October 2021. The third console, the Xbox One,
      was released in November 2013 and has sold 51 million units.[2] The fourth
      line of Xbox consoles, the Xbox Series X and Series S, were released in
      November 2020. The head of Xbox is Phil Spencer, who succeeded former head
      Marc Whitten in late March 2014.[3][4] History When Sony Computer
      Entertainment first announced the PlayStation 2 in 1999, the company had
      positioned the console as a centerpiece for home entertainment, as it not
      only would play video games, but also could play audio CDs and video DVDs.
      Microsoft, whose business had been primarily in supporting the personal
      computer (PC) business with its Windows operating system, software, and
      games, saw the PlayStation 2 as a threat to the personal computer.[5] Four
      engineers from Microsoft's DirectX teamâ€”Kevin Bachus, Seamus Blackley, Ted
      Hase and DirectX team leader Otto Berkes, began to envision what a
      Microsoft console to compete against the PlayStation 2 would be like. They
      designed a system that would use many hardware components in common with
      PCs, effectively running a version of Windows and DirectX to power the
      games on the console.[6][5] This approach would make it easy for
      developers on Windows to build games for their new system, differentiating
      itself from the custom hardware solutions of most consoles.[7][8] Numerous
      names were suggested for this console, including "Direct X Box",[9] and
      the "Windows Entertainment Project".[10] Microsoft's marketing team
      conducted consumer surveys of the name, using the name "Xbox" as a control
      believing this would be least desirable, but found that this had the
      highest preference from their tests, and was selected as the name of the
      console.[11] While the original Xbox had modest sales, Microsoft took a
      large financial loss to support it. However, its performance was
      sufficient to convince the company to continue to produce the line. Since
      its release, there have been four generations of Xbox, with the most
      recent being the Xbox Series X and Series S units. The Xbox has become a
      direct competitor to Sony's PlayStation brand, both offering high
      performance gaming systems at roughly similar specifications.
